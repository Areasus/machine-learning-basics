# Linear regression uses the relationship between the data-points to draw a straight line through all them.
# Polynomial regression uses the relationship between the variables x and y to find the best way to draw a line through the  points.
# Multiple regression is like linear regression, but with more than one independent value, meaning predict a value based on two or more variables.
